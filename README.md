# HDFT
Accurate correspondence between BIM and construction instances using high-dimensional point cloud feature tensor

  Accurate correspondences between as-designed BIM and as-built construction point cloud instances play a critical role in construction progress management.

  In our study, we fully exploit the hierarchical geometric-semantic-instance information within BIM and establish a high-dimension point cloud feature tensor to propose an effective method (HDFT) for accurate correspondence between BIM and construction instances. 

  HDFT contains a high-dimension point cloud feature tensor embedded network for BIM-to-construction semantic transferring and an incremental point-to-point correspondence estimation strategy for BIM-and-construction point cloud instance corresponding.

  HDFT was applied to the main stadium for the 31st Summer World University Games. Four-phase global and local construction progress of the total 38 317 instances (steel structure, facade grating, aluminum plate, and glass roof) were automatically documented in both quantitative and visual forms, with a progress percentage error of approximately 1%. 

  
  We will release all codes after the publication of our paper.
